# half-sunday-unity-template
Half Sunday is a jam collective composed of Chris Knoll, Jess Wiedman, Brock Thorne, Dalton Wright, and David ???. This is our unity project template, where I (Chris) am going to try to keep our code that can be shared between projects.

This template is supposed to serve as a sandbox and introduction to UI, Input, Character Controller, etc. systems that will be created for the jammers personal projects, and all works created by the group. This readme will be updated over time to essentially be a text walkthrough and psuedo-documentation for anything found in this project.
